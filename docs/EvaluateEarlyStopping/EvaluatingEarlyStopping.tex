This documentation shows the evaluation of early stopping algorithms. 

\section{Problem}
Given samples $\textbf{x}$ from treatment group, samples $\textbf{y}$ from control group, We are interested in whether there is a significant difference  between the mean the two variants $\delta = \mu(y)-\mu(x)$.

To save the cost of long-running experiments, we want to stop early if we are already certain that there is a significant result.

\section{Significance Decision}
\label{sec:byt}
Given $H_0$ represents the null hypothesis of no difference, $H_1$ represents the alternative hypothesis meaning there is a difference, we can decide whether the result is statistically significant using either:

\begin{itemize}  
\item \textbf{Confidence interval}: If 0 is outside confidence interval of $\delta$, it is statistically significant. Vice versa.
\item or \textbf{credible interval}: Credible interval is the Bayesian version of confidence interval. If 0 is outside credible interval of $\delta$, it is statistically significant. Vice versa.
\item or \textbf{Bayes factor}: Theoretically, Bayes factors higher than 3 can be interpreted as support for the null hypothesis (significant no difference), whereas values smaller than 1/3 can be interpreted as support for the alternative hypothesis (significant difference). Values between 1/3 and 3 are inconclusive. \textbf{In our test, we will only use Bayes factor less than 1/3 as decision criteria}. See reasons below.
\end{itemize}

The ability of each metric, i.e., types of significance it can detect, is shown in the following table.
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ | r | c | c | c | c | }
    \hline
    & Paradigm & Significant $H_1$ & Significant $H_0$ & No Significant Result \\ \hline
    \textbf{Confidence Interval} & frequentist &  \Checkmark &  & \Checkmark\\ \hline
    \textbf{Credible Interval} & Bayesian & \Checkmark &  & \Checkmark\\ \hline
    \textbf{Bayes factor} & Bayesian & \Checkmark & \Checkmark & \Checkmark\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\captionof{table}{Comparison of Decision Ability}
\end{center}

To be consistent with all mehods, we draw a binary conclusion that either there is a significant difference or not. In other words, the first column means that there is a significant difference, combining the second and third column means that there is no significant difference. Thus, we only use the part where Bayes factor less than 1/3 as decision criteria.

It is worth noting that a \textbf{typical conclusion of Bayes factor} would be "\emph{There is a significant difference corresponds to Cauchy prior and a threshold of Bayes factor=3}". This might be quite difficult to explain to non-tech users. While the \textbf{conclusion based on interval} can be more intuitive such as "\emph{You can be 95\% sure that the significant difference is not due to chance}".


\section{Early Stopping Criteria}
We can stop the experiment by either
\begin{itemize}  
\item \textbf{Confidence interval}: Calculate the new significance level for each day based on alpha-spending function in group sequential method. Stop the test If 0 is outside confidence interval of $\delta$. 
\item or \textbf{credible interval}: Stop the test if 0 is outside credible interval of $\delta$.
\item or \textbf{Bayes factor}: Stop the test if Bayes factor is smaller than 1/3 (significant difference).
\item or \textbf{Bayes precision}: Stop the test if credible interval width is smaller than 0.08. 
\end{itemize}


\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Evaluate Significance Decision}
We are going to compute FP(Type I error), FN(Type II error), TP, TN rates for the three significance decision algorithms described in Section ~\ref{sec:byt}.

\subsection{Evaluate Early Stopping Criteria}
\label{sec:esc}
It is obvious that if we use the frequentist approach in early stopping, we should also use frequentist's approach (that is confidence interval) to decide significance. Moreover, when using Bayes factor to stop, we often find a conflicting result if we draw significance conclusion based on credible interval. Therefore we don't evaluate all combinations of early stopping algorithms and significance decision algorithms, find below a table of combination we will evaluate.

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ | r | c | c | c | c | }
    \hline
    \multirow{2}{*}{Significant Based On} & \multicolumn{4}{ |c| }{Early Stopping Based On} \\ \cline{2-5}
    & Confidence Interval & Credible Interval & Bayes factor & Bayes precision \\ \hline
    Confidence Interval & \Checkmark & &  &  \\ \hline
    Credible Interval &  & \Checkmark &  &  \\ \hline
    Bayes factor &  & & \Checkmark & \Checkmark \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\captionof{table}{Combinations of Early Stopping and Significance Decision To Evaluate}
\end{center}

For each combination shown in the table above, we will evaluate the following metrics:
\begin{itemize}  
\item \textbf{False positive rate}: Percentage of wrongly stopped tests. i.e., Early stop says there is a significant difference and stops the test, but the test to the end day (as if there is no early stopping) will tell you it is not significant.
\item \textbf{Run time reduced(all)}: Percentage of run time reduced for all tests.
\item \textbf{Run time reduced(true positive)}: Percentage of run time reduced for only the correctly stopped tests.
\item \textbf{Bias}: Percentage of the difference of effect size(delta) between stopping day and end day of test(as if there is no early stopping).
\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation}

The evaluation is conducted on both simulation data and real data. Code can be found \href{https://github.com/shansfolder/ABTestingEarlyStoppingEvaluation}{\underline{here}}.

\subsection{Simulation Data}
We generate 2000 simulation tests based on Gaussian distributed KPIs. We calculate the minimal detectable effect size from power analysis. 1000 tests have a significant difference between control and treatment, and the other 1000 tests have no significant difference. 

We model the frequency of visits of an entity by a Poisson distribution with 3 days per entity in average. We simulate the A/B testing for a period of 20 days, and decide whether to stop on each day.

First of all, let's see the performance of different \textbf{significance decision} algorithms.
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ | r | c | c | c | c | }
    \hline
    & FPR & TNR & FNR & TPR \\ \hline
    \textbf{confidence interval} & 4.6\% & 95.4\% & 0.9\% & 99.1\% \\ \hline
    \textbf{credible interval} & 4.6\% & 95.4\% & 1.0\% & 99.0\% \\ \hline
    \textbf{Bayes factor} & 0.2\% & 99.8\% & 18.9\% & 81.1\%\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\captionof{table}{Performance of Significance Decision on Simulation Data}
\end{center}

We can observe in Figure \ref{fig:roc_sim_data} that Bayes factor works very good on false positive rate, but the two interval based approaches works better on true positive rate. In general, the error rate of all three methods are acceptable(FPR < 5\% and FNR < 80\%) for simulation data. 

\begin{figure} 
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.6]{roc_sim_data.png}
\caption{ROC plot on simulation data}
\label{fig:roc_sim_data}
\end{figure}

Next, let's look at the results of \textbf{early stopping} algorithms. To make notations compact, in the following table we use FPR for false positive rate, RTR(all) for run time reduced(all), RTR(TP) for run time reduced(true positive) and CI for confidence interval. The definition of each metric is described previously in Section ~\ref{sec:esc}.

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ | r | r | c | c | c | c | c | }
    \hline
    \textbf{Significance} & \textbf{Early Stopping}  & \textbf{Paradigm} & \textbf{FPR} & \textbf{RTR(all)} & \textbf{RTR(TP)} & \textbf{Bias} \\ \hline\hline
    CI &  CI & frequentist & & &  &  \\ \hline
    Credible Interval & Credible Interval & Bayesian &  & &  &  \\ \hline
    Bayes factor & Bayes factor & Bayesian & & &  &  \\ \hline
    Bayes factor & Bayes precision & Bayesian &  & &  &  \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\captionof{table}{Performance of Early Stopping on Simulation Data}
\end{center}


\subsection{Real Data}
Repeat the evaluation process on real data from previous A/B testings.

\section{Conclusion}
Choose a significance decision and an early stopping algorithm.
%Use group sequential and confidence interval.
